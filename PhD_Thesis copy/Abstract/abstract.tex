From population collapses to cell-fate decision, critical phenomena are abundant in complex real-world systems. Among modelling theories to address them, the critical transitions framework gained traction for its purpose of determining classes of critical mechanisms and identifying generic indicators to detect and alert them (``early warning signals''). This thesis contributes to such research field by elucidating its relevance within the systems biology landscape, by providing  a systematic classification of leading mechanisms for critical transitions, and by assessing the theoretical and empirical performance of early warning signals. The thesis thus bridges general results concerning the critical transitions field -- possibly applicable to multidisciplinary contexts -- and specific applications in biology and epidemiology, towards the development of sound risk monitoring system.
