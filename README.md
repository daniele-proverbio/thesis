# PhD thesis
PhD thesis: code to generate figures and manuscript.  
For chapters based on articles, the code for figures and results is shared in dedicated repositories (see links in manuscript).

## Software
Three languages and progras are used, depending on the task: Python (v. 3.9.7), Mathematica (v. 12) and Matlab (v. 2021b). No fancy packages are required, except for the most common ones. 

## Repository organization
Each folder, project or Jupyter section is named according to corresponding thesis chapter or figure.   
Some final figures are created using Inkscape, combining single-generated sub-figures. Other scketches have been created using PowerPoint. They are not included in this repository.

## Credits
Author: Daniele Proverbio, LCSB, 2018 - 2022 (daniele.proverbio@outlook.com).  
Please cite the corresponding thesis if you use any figure or code.
